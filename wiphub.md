Hello! I'm Pickle, and I make shredders in Plane Crazy on Roblox.
<br>
I make resources for help with making shredders, and this links to all of them.

Note: This is still a WIP. I'm by no means done with making these silly websites.

## Shredder Resources

Here are my resources for help with making shredders.

- [Custom Shredder Camos](https://folxh.github.io/ShredderCamos/)

## Fun

My websites for fun with making shredders, not extensive guides or anything like that (coming soon).

- [Exact Demean](https://folxh.github.io/ExactDemean/)
- [Random Shreddder Generator](https://folxh.github.io/RandomShredder/)

## Notes 
For a description of these websites, look at their readme.

Thanks for visiting!
